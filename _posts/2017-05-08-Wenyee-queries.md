According to the data of [2010-2014 Evanston Employment Rates](https://data.cityofevanston.org/dataset/2010-2014-Evanston-Employment-Rates/e99c-ia96/data) from the City of Evanston, Evanston employment rate had been going down during these five years.

The employment rates of the whole Evanston residents and the white residents had similar trends appearing on the chart below, which was dropping. It shows that white people could be the majority of the whole Evanston resident, which affected the whole employment rate a lot.

In 2010, Evanston employment rate was 62.4 percent, while in 2014, the rate went down to 59.5 percent. As for the white employment, it was reducing from 63.4 percent to 61.6 percent in 5 years.

However, the trend of the Asian employment rate was apparently different from those of two. In 2010, its employment rate was 51.9 percent, but in 2015, it rose to 52 percent.

The data shows Asian employment rate had less influence than the white employment rate to the whole Evanston employment rate.

Analysis of Jail Bookings in Miami Dade County (2015-2017)
By Marianna Brady

This data looks at jail bookings in Miami Dade county from May 29, 2015 to current time. It was last updated today. The data provides information on the arrest such as defendant's name, birthdate, and what they were charged with. It also includes the location of the arrest.

Most importantly, the data includes the book date in the first column. That allowed me to do a query to find out the number of jail bookings per month over this period of time.

In that time period, the most jail bookings in one month occurred in August 2015. Excluding the incomplete months (May 2015 and May 2017), the fewest jail bookings occurred in November 2016 with 4,187.

In Postman I did a query and grouped by month. I had to use the code [date_trunc_ym(bookdate) as month] to figure it out and run the query to get the monthly jail bookings data.

My [data](https://opendata.miamidade.gov/resource/k7xd-qgzt.csv?$group=month&$select=date_trunc_ym(bookdate) as month,count(*) as total&$order=month)
